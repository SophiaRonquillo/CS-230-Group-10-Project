## This is the main page for the Company, "VirtuaRead Labs". 
### VirtuaRead Labs is a company that has developed an app designed to provide real-time subtitles for conversations using augmented reality glasses, specifically the Nreal Air. The app, currently available for Android, transcribes spoken words into text, making communication more accessible for the deaf and hard of hearing. The glasses need to be connected to a smartphone for the app to function, and the transcriptions are also saved for later reference.
